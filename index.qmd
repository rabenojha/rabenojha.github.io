Hi everyone, my name is Rabin Ojha. I am originally from Nepal but currently based in Germany. 

I have a Bachelor's degree in Geomatics Engineering and Master's degree in Earth Observation, Geoinformatics and Geovisualization. My interest lies in open geospatial data, cartography and working with remote sensing for disasters. I have around 4 years of experience in the geospatial domain.
